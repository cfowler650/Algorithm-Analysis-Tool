## Algorithm Analysis Tool

 An algorithm analysis tool built to watch in real time how various sorting algorithms perform under the hood in a visual and interactive way. I was inspired to build this after studying merge sort and then shortly after learning about quick sort and how efficient it was. Technologies used for this project are: Javascript, React, CSS, HTML.
